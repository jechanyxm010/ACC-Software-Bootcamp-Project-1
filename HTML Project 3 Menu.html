	<p>Are you hungry? I am <em>really</em> hungry? If so, we recommend you pick this dish!  Fluffy pancakes, eggs over easy, crispy bacon, refried beans, a heapin' mountain of fried potatoes, and an omlette with green and red bell peppers.  Come with a side of tomato and avocado (bleh).</p>
<h3>Bacon and Eggs</h3>

	<p>You can't go wrong with the classics.  Two eggs server over easy and two slices of cripy bacon.

<h3>Plain and simple Eggs</h3>

	<p>Looking for something filled with protein? Two eggs, served any way you like.<p>

	<p>Talk about a carb overload!  Seven stacks of mini pancakes shaped like hearts.  Comes with a side of ample syrup and butter.<p>
